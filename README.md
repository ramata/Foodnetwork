# Project 2-Foodnetwork Recipes App

Welcome to the Foodnetwork Recipes App! We help people connect with each other through these amazing recipes.

This project builds a simple app using the ME(A)N Stack. Passport is used for authentication (signup, login, and logout).

I envisioned this app to be a platform for users to find all sorts of recipes. 

To accomplish this, I built a Recipe Model and a User Model.

The Foodnetwork Recipes app brings that fan/chef relationship out of the living room and into the kitchen of users.

The users can sign up, login, then view the recipes.

The users can interact with each other, review recipes and share tips on how to improve a recipe.

For this project, I used the following technologies:

1. Express 
2. Node 
3. MongoDB/Mongoose 
4. Passport 
5. toddmotto/public-apis API 
6. Bootstrap 
7. Heroku 
8. npm

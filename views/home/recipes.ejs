                          Known as the Feast of the Seven Fishes, this tradition-steeped meal draws
                          family members together to enjoy a multitude of courses while they await
                          the impending arrival of Christmas. The meal typically entails quite a few
                          different kinds of fish prepared
                          in a variety of ways: alone, in pasta, as an appetizer or even as a stew.</li>
